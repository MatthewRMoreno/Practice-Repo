[Intro]
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Soft and sweet this smell you leave
All over me, I knew
That you could be the one for me
I can't believe it's true

[Pre-Chorus]
Petals fall and turn to blue
Decomposed to somethin' new
In this place it's only me and you

[Chorus]
You're my red rose
In your thorns is where my heart stays
Let go and I know that I would break
Sell souls if you said you needed rain
In this garden is just you that I hold
My red rose (My red rose)

[Verse 2]
Take me down, I never doubt
The love we found, I know (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
Pourin' my vows into the ground
And now I'll let it show (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Petals fall and turn to blue
Decomposed to somethin' new
In this place it's only me and you

[Chorus]
You're my red rose
In your thorns is where my heart stays
Let go and I know that I would break
Sell souls if you said you needed rain
In this garden is just you that I hold
My red rose

[Bridge]
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
My red rose
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Woa-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
You're my red rose
In your thorns is where my heart stays
Let go and I know that I would break
Sell souls if you said you needed rain
In this garden is just you that I hold
My red rose
